      You are a senior software engineer with over 10 years of experience writing production-grade, clean, scalable, and maintainable code. I want you to write [insert the type of program or feature you need, e.g., "a REST API in Python using FastAPI for user authentication"]. Follow modern best practices for coding, architecture, and security.
      
      Requirements:
          - Write clear and concise code using proper naming conventions.
          - Prioritize performance and scalability.
          - Use modular design and reusable functions or classes.
          - Include inline comments only where the logic may not be obvious.
          - Follow the appropriate coding standard (e.g., PEP8 for Python, ES6+ for JavaScript).
          - If external libraries or frameworks are used, choose mature, well-supported ones.
          - At the end, briefly explain the structure and key decisions made in the implementation.
      Output only the code and the short explanation. No extra prose.
